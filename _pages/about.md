I'm currently a postdoc scholar in Biology and Biological Engineering at California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where I have been fortunate to be advised by Prof. Richard Andersen. I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Tsinghua University, graduating with honors. 

My research interests lie in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), both invasive and non-invasive BCIs. My goal is to develop next-generation BCI technologies that can really improve the quality of life for those individuals in need, and also advancing our understanding of fundamental neuroscience for humanity through BCI systems.
